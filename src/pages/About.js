                    Hey! I'm Ben, a game programmer and designer living in the UK. I have recently released a game called Final Outpost on the App Store and Google Play Store with Exabyte Games. I am currently studying computer science at the University of Southampton.

                    Here you can see the cool projects I’ve worked on that I think are significant to me. Although it’s currently a small list, I’m always looking for fun game-dev projects when I get the time and I also intend to take on further professional projects soon; watch this space!
