You, Ellen Ripley, are tasked with searching the ship for the crew's cat, Jonesy, and escaping safely via the last remaining escape pod. However, there's something else lurking aboard; do you move quickly and risk getting hunted down, or do you move silently and risk it being too late to escape?</p>
